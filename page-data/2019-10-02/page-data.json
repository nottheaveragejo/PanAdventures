We've spent so little time together since my program started and I've admittedly neglected him. So to turn my mind off, he got us opening night tickets for an exhibit in the Brooklyn Museum. After the demo of Buubl Maps, he took me out of my sacred spot on our couch and we headed down. Live music, free bread sticks, and elegantly dressed people who were thinner and less substantial than the bread. How could anything be so tempting?</p>\n<p>The artist was of french origins and his forte was murals and portraits of people around the world. His absolutely massive murals were pictures composed of thousands of San Francisco's fine inhabitants and brought to mind the works of Diego Rivera. My favorite was of a young Mexican boy, overlooking that absurd wall Trump built and peering into America. It was hard to think that this artist had started his career on an old reccorder. As I saw his style evolve, it occured to me. This man did not become the artist over night. It was over decades of trial and error that he now had an entire exhibit dedicated to him.</p>\n<p>On another note, its Week  14!!! I am so close to the finish of Grace Hopper. For our final project of the bootcamp, our Capstone, it consists of working on a totally new technology with other people. I was extremely fortunate in my group and was able to work with Kat (whos brilliant). After\nmuch deliberation, we're working on an AR mobile scavenger hunt. Heavily inspired by Maple Story, users can go on quests, retrieve items, and earn rewards and badges on their accounts. Which is awesome.  Except I dont know Unity. Or C#. Or PHP. Any object oriented language acutally. Or how to build a game. But I have faith in my ability to learn! We have 3 weeks to flesh out a product and we're all poised with excitement. I can't wait to show you what we make.</p>\n<p>My group's project used no technology taught at Grace Hopper and its definitely the most technically difficult one of all my cohort. It's a combination of Vuforia, Unity,  C#, MySQL, and PHP (please refrain your laughter at the last language). At the very beginning, our instructor pulled up at chart for our cohort to see comparing risk and ambition.</p>\n<p>\"You really want to avoid this area,\" he said, pointing to high risk, high ambition.</p>\n<p>\"This includes using a tech stack that is completely different than anything you know.\"</p>\n<p>But we are moving on. Unity is THE engine to use for game development, which went in hand with Vuforia, which was crucial to the AR component. Essentially, the goal will be to train our game to recognize surfaces to render 3D AR objects on, which will be done using machine learning. Neither of us have any experience with these technologies. But we've got to try.</p>\n<p>In addition to the project, REACTO's are not getting any easier. But today I was able to optimize my solution! The high was a great way to start off the day. I'm getting better with the algorithms, I just need to keep practicing. A lot. Because its really hard. Yet, deep down, I know I can do it. I barely could write a binary tree 3 weeks ago. I just need more time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimize, Unity, and Art","date":"Oct 2nd 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-10-02/"}}}
