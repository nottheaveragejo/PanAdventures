This store is\nJay Z's favorite. It's a staple of pizza lovers and the adulation of the\nmost cynical of people. Lucali is a New York legend, so I figured after the marathon that was Junior phase that I should experience this fable of a food first hand.</p>\n<p>Async week is the much needed break between Junior and Senior phase. After spending the first 2 days sleeping and binge watching the Great British Bake Off, I figured I should do something outside my apartment, and what better way than to go on a self proclaimed food tour and study algorithms?</p>\n<p>In the mornings I did some leetcode. Man, I really suck at this. I suppose I just have to keep practicing and not get discouraged at my stodgy solutions.</p>\n<p>In the afternoons I did as I pleased. Which meant wandering in the village, stepping into my most beloved stationary stores to feel creamy papers, talking to stressed out NYU students, and of course, eating. Now, I wasn't always an eater. Mostly, I eat for social acceptance (read family dinners)but because I do, I gourge and save my calories.</p>\n<p>Most notably this week were the Dosa Man in Washington square park and Lucali. Both of these waits were obscene. I got to the Dosa Man's cart 30 minutes before he opened and watched as he threw the scraps to the birds. His pondicherri dosa is sublime. Vegan, it packs such a punch of flavor and contrasting texture and the man behind it, Thiru, is a sweet man.</p>\n<p>Geared up for my next task, I biked my way over to Brooklyn for Lucali. I greatly underestimated my opponent. The earliest table I could obtain was 2 hours away.  After getting there 45 minutes before it opened. On a Wednesday. My boyfriend met me there after work. His absolute favorite meal is pizza and after watching SO many reviews, he was eager to try. So willing that we wandered in Carroll Gardens for 2 hours. For this pizza, I endured 10 mosquito bites and an Australian mother handing me tissues to blot my  sweat drenched face as I dripped on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Oh, but the reward? A pretty damn fine slice of margharita. Its thin, yet chewy, the sauce complex and well seasoned. They'll offer you toppings, but look away. This pizza needs one.  But the real winner was the calzone. Oh that wonderfully crisp, sinfully creamy calzone. It was underrated but the start of the meal.</p>\n<p>Can I say this was the best slice in New York? Not sure if it holds a candle to the Nonna Maria, but its pretty delicious. The best pizza I ever had? Solid no. That goes to the smokey margharita in Spring Valley Brewery in Kyoto. It feels a little sacreligious as a New York native to say it, but its true, so sorry pizza purists. That restaurant was the best dining experience I ever had. So good that I went every day I was in Kyoto. I wasn't even supposed to go there, I just so happened to be walking by. But after dinner the first night, I walked to Pontocho Alley, stunned by the experience, by being in Japan, and watched the lights dance on the cobbled streets.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mission Impossible: Lucalis","date":"Sep 10th 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-09-10/"}}}
