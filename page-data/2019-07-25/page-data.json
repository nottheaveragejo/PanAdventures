My name is Lisa Jo. I've jumped\noff 50 story cliffs, biked across 6 islands and 6 bridges in 2 days, wrote a novel, rode\ngo carts in live street traffic in Tokyo, but\ntoday marks an especially daring feat for me. I've been accepted\ninto Grace Hopper Academy, an all women's immersive software engineering bootcamp.</p>\n<p>I've quit my job, tuned my brompton, and am off on what I hope will\nbe a grand adventure. Because I believe in myself. That I can do more, that I can\nbe better.</p>\n<p>If you told me four years ago I would have been interested in computers,\nI would have laughed. Back then, I studied cardiomyocytes in college as my research,\nscored in the 97 percentile on my PCAT, and taught organic chemistry and\nanatomy. Yet, it was so empty. Essentially, I lied to myself for 4 years of\nundergraduate in a desperate attempt to be the person I thought I should be.\nIt wasn't until my spring semester of senior year that I decided I would\nnot go through the motions any longer and pursued something I truly cared\nabout.</p>\n<p>After 2 years of writing for something I did not believe in and\nstruggling to find an audience to critique my novel, it was my boyfriend\nwho had given me a course in software engineering.</p>\n<p>\"What do you possible have to learn,\" he told me.</p>\n<p>And I was hooked. I blew through the course, marveling at my ability to\nwork through the complex problems and created something that I formerly thought I\nwas unable to do. I loved it so much that I created my own writing platform\nso that other writers could get critique on their writing as well.</p>\n<p>I wanted so badly to be better, to break free from my former career that\nI took the leap and have been free falling ever since.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The First Step","date":"Jul 25th 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-07-25/"}}}
