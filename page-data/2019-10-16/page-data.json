Positively tizzy with my own mastery. Yes, I am aware how self centered that sounds. I can say that I gave all I could to this project. I learned a simply monumental amount. I have pulled this game to reality with my own hands and computer.</p>\n<p>Time has made a fool of me. I'm already in the next to last week of Grace Hopper and the time has come to NOT SLEEP. There is always something more to do. Whether its career services politely urging me to finalize my resume, errors with deploying personal projects, or rewriting the backend for Apple Crumble, it seems as though there is simply not enough time in the day for me to finish.</p>\n<p>Yet I've done it. I learned 2 languages, a game engine, and a new database and have an exquisite game to show for it. Not only is it compatible on android and ios, its totally and utterly mine and Kat's. We did the work of 4 people to build a scavenger hunt where users can go on quests using AR. We have worked ourselves and pushed ourselves beyong our limits.</p>\n<p>Family and friends night was tonight and my perennially supportive, unwaveringly wonderful boyfriend came. A time to showcase the projects that my cohort has been working on for the last few weeks, I was extremely pleased with the share depth and amount of work that I had done on it. We presented Apple Crumble to the class and it was well received.</p>\n<p>Erika's, a girl from my cohort, mother in law came and she had the biggest smile watching the tiger and knight render on screen for her. Jaqueline and Siwin,fellow cohort members, had so much fun on the game, as did the strangers that passed by. That feeling of watching people play something that Kat and I had made, doing the work of 4 people, and enjoying themselves. Truly, genuinely enjoying themselves and the game play. The high was unbelievable.</p>\n<p>My boyfriend and I didn't linger. We left quietly and I was grateful for that. He seems to know what I'm thinking before I even say it.\nIt was a noreaster day of blustery winds and cold sheets of rain. The street lights had turned on and it was dark outside. As we rode the bus back home, he looked at me in a very kind sort of way. His eyes were shining.</p>\n<p>\"You make me so proud. Keep pursuing your dreams.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reflections","date":"Oct 16th 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-10-16/"}}}
