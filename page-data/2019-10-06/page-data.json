A software engineer at Amazon, if anyone could answer it it would be\nhim.</p>\n<p>\"Well, that depends.\"</p>\n<p>\"On what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you slow time?\"</p>\n<p>And so the race was on to learn object oriented programming. Its week 15 and\nboy, Capstone tensions are high. After 3 days of fiddling around on Unity,\nI can respect and appreciate it for what it is. Well thought out and with tons of tools, I can see why this is the premier way to go for game development. The\nlearning curve is the only hindrance.</p>\n<p>Writing my first C# scripts was a wonderful experience. I got the logic to navigate to different screens and the buttons to work. Small challenges,\nbut I'm just happy it works. The UI is done and its so lovely! Still need to get the actual database done, but it's working.Its been interesting delving into so many technologies for this project. I had to use MySQL instead of our taught PSQL for our databases and its been intriguing to see the differences.</p>\n<p>Kat has been doing a ton of heavy lifting, she's done an absurd amount of\nthought and research in our project all while staying completely level headed and calm. Its\ncompletely unfounded territory for us and I'm proud that we\nare doing our best, especially since most groups have 4 people. She's pushing me to do more, easy to work with, an absolutely marvelous person, and I'm lucky we work well as a team.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I wandered around the west village and Washington square parks.\nThere's nothing quite like fall in New York. The leaves were fringed in\nbrowns and reds, making them look as though they were on fire. A bluesy\njazz from saxophones played. I ventured deeper west until I was almost at\nthe water when I saw a lovely couple reciting their vows. The brides\nwere dabbing away the wetness from their eyes. There couldn't have\nbeen more than 20 people at that ceremony, a quiet little slice of\ngreen church. I watched behind the bars of the gates as they became a couple\nbefore walking away.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Apple Crumble and Beers","date":"Oct 6th 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-10-06/"}}}
