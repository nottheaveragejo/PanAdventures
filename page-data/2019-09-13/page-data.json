We ended up making a bubble tea shop, complete\nwith payment and cart. The cart was definitely tricky and the relations. for the\nmodels tougher than expected, but it was done and I was so proud of us\nwhen we presented it. </p>\n<p>When our amazing program lead asked us to go around the room, to show appreciation\nfor anyone during our project, my teammate said my name. I was absolutely shocked.\nThe entire time, I wish I could have done more. But when one of then acknowledged\nme, that I had been an anchor in our team that had grounded us and had done\nthe lifting that needed to be done. How I had been the mastermind of merges and git\nand branches. </p>\n<p>\"She is so young and smart,\" another one of my teammates added on.</p>\n<p>I was floored. As someone that doubts my intelligence daily, I couldn't believe\nwhat I had heard. Me. Smart. By women who were so intelligent, who for so long\nI felt outclassed me and I didn't deserve to be around. I biked back to my apartment that night, grinning\nlike a fool.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the week, well, it was . . . interesting. After our e-commerce sites\nwere done we swan dived into stackathon. A solo project, we used whatever technology\nour hearts desired, provided it was done in 4 days. Full of ballooned optimism and building off\nmy love of bubble tea from the e-commerce site, I foolishly believed my task was easy. Boy,\nwas I wrong.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Anchor"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-09-13/"}}}
