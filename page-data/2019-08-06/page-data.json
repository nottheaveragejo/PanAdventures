Those seem so far away.</p>\n<p>This week was all about the back end. The best analogy I can think of between\nthe front end and back end is that imagine\nseeing an ice berg floating in the ice blue water. No matter how it appears from\nsea level, there is no way to fathom the depths and complexities that\nlurk underneath the surface. There is a surprising intricacy to the back end,\na dance between making requests, storing data, and getting the data needed back.\nMy program focused on Express, Node.js, and Sequelize and we learned it all this week. Can I say how awesome\nit is that JavaScript can be run server side using Node? I know that its\nnot a perfect language but its pretty rewarding seeing the backend being\nimplemented, especially in our pair programming exercises. I've tried to\nread every single bit of material distributed before hand, redo the pair exercises\nwhen I come home, but I've come the realization that my effort is as futile\nas filling a sieve with sand. I'll just have to study smarter and think more\ncritically for this class. I've been coming in 30 minutes prior to class starting\ntime to attend morning review, where a teaching staff will go over any questions\nfrom the day prior material. Hopefully, it works out.</p>\n<p>In addition to normal class, we have take home tests to do. To us, they're\nknown as checkpoints. Covering each technology we learn, we're supposed to complete\nthem. They're tricky but a good gage to see how well you can build on the information given.</p>\n<p>In other news of my personal life, which is ever dwindling since the program began,\nI went to watch toy story 4. Now, let me say it now. The peas in a pod from the third\nmovie is my favorite toy of the series. Hands Down. They're names are Peatey,\nPeatrice, and Peanelope. How do I know this? Its because during my monthly visit\nto the Disney store in Times square the employee told me so. So there.</p>\n<p>Throughout the whole movie, I waited patiently for the 3 peas to appear. For\nthe entire runtime, I wanted a glimmer of those 3 peas to show up. My adorable\ntriples. Instead I was rewarded with Woody being hacked apart for his voice box,\nthe schism from his original crew, and a tiny boxing day french canadian figure.\nMy dissapointment only continued at Dairy Queen, where they had no chocolate ice\ncream and I watched my boyfriend and his friends eat their peanut butter blizzards.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite, or in spite of the movie,I knew that there was more work to be done.\nSo I went home and read the material for the next day of class. I need to give it all I have. And I will not say I did not do my best.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Toy Story 4, the work begins","date":"Aug 6th 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-08-06/"}}}
