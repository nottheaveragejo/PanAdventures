My backpack is packed,\nclothes picked out, and I cant be more excited. I know, I'm such a shameless nerd.\nThe first week was not as daunting as I anticipated. There's 22 girls in my class\nor cohort as Grace Hopper refers to it. Its a mixed bag. There are those\nwho graduated college weeks ago, others with Phd's, those with no experience and\nothers who worked as software engineers. Everyone's been welcoming and with that,\nwe started pair programming, ie, the preferred method of teaching in the Grace Hopper\nSpectrum. Its an agile technique, where one writes code while another views the code\nbeing written. The idea behind it is that the two will blend together seamlessly\nand they will benefit from the other's way of thinking. Or something\nalong those lines.</p>\n<p>One of the aspects I am appreciating most about the experience is the sheer\nplethora of experienced individuals who can answer my questions. It is\nnigh impossible to not find help here. From the teaching staff that offers\ntons of hours to the teaching fellows (akin to teaching assistants) coming\nto you in your darkest times of need, it would be stupid not to take\nadvantage of the resources. It makes failing incredible hard to do so.</p>\n<p>In addition to my program, I am game for the task of finding a new apartment!\nI've lived my current apartment since college and I'm oddly nostalgic. From the neon sign outside my bedroom window that reminds me strawberry pink tones that I'm trash to the post war facade that mocks the passerbys, it was my first big girl home.Though I made a lot of memories here, it left a lot to be desired. Like not living below 2 sorority NYU girls who throw ragers at 2 AM on Wednesday nights and leave delightful presents of vodka laced puddles in the hallway. Or my packages that were delivered from over a month overseas being stolen. But I digress.</p>\n<p>This was my first home. I bought furniture for this place, 2 rooms full\nof ikea. I went on Memorial Day weekend with my two roommates. We sat on\nevery single couch, trying desperately to find one that fit into our boxcar\nstyle 300 square apartment. We spent every day after work furiously assembling\nas much as we could, screwing and hammering away the plywood boards together\nand eating pizza off of a microwave.</p>\n<p>But it's time to move on.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Week Of Class","date":"Aug 1st 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-08-01/"}}}
