It was only after getting accepted into pharmacy school and working\n    at CVS in my senior year of college did I decide to jump ship. After much\n    deliberation and trial and error, I set out to write my first novel, Overture.\n    It was written after the spiritual experience of being at a Porter Robinson\n    concert. All the mental blocks faded and the day after, I penned the first\n    page. Pretty soon, I had a manuscript. But when I tried to get feedback for others\n    to read it, I didn't have an audience. This was problematic, so I decided to\n    build my own writing platform where fellow writers can critique and review other'school work as well as receive feedback on their own. I was hooked. It was the beginning of my journey into software engineering, something I hope I can share with all of you.</p>\n\n    <p>\n      Currently, I live in the heart of the village in NYC with plently of plants\n      and mementos of my travels. I think that noodles are the most underappreciated carb in existence and bike about 70 miles a week on a turkish green Brompton. When I'm not writing software and scripts, I'm working on my query letter for Overture.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      I spend my time wandering around in art galleries, nature, and random spots\n      in NYC. The treasures you can find are stunning and amongst my favorite are\n      30 plays in 60 minutes, the best rose lychee kakigori, and a snugly nestled\n      stationary store.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>Thanks for reading my blog. I hope it makes you smile.</p>\n\n    <p> All the best, Lisa </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n\n\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/lisa-profile-3016078fac3f7088670811caff1b9ff2.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
