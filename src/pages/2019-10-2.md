Its Week  14!!! I am so close to the finish of Grace Hopper. For our final project, our Capstone, it consists of working on a totally new technology with other people. I was extremely fortunate in my group and was able to work with Kat (whos brilliant) and Shirin(equally so). After
much deliberation, we're working on an AR scavenger hunt. Which is awesome. Except I dont know
Unity. Or C+. Or how to build a game. But I have faith in my ability to learn! We have 3 weeks to flesh out a product and we're all poised with excitement. I can't wait to show
you what we make.

In addition to the project, REACTO's are not getting any easier. But today I was able to optimize my solution! The high was a great way to start off the day. I'm getting better with the algorithms, I just need to keep practicing. A lot. Because its really hard. Yet, deep down, I know I can do it. I barely could write a binary tree 3 weeks ago. I just need more time. And lots and lots of practice.


ALTER TABLE `Players` ADD `QuestinProg` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER `score`, ADD `ItemsFound` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  AFTER `QuestinProg`, ADD `HasMet` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER `ItemsFound`, ADD `HasAccepted` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  AFTER `HasMet`, ADD `HasCompleted` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  AFTER `HasAccepted`;
