It is done! I am moved into my new aparment. A wonderful studio, I adore everything about it. From the view of the outstretched buildings to the outside patio. I love the floor to ceiling mirror, the space it has to store pots and pans. Best of all, a washer and dryer in building! I am so stoked to be doing my own laundry after spending 2 years paying for it to be done for me. To let the warm, freshly spun clothes pile up on me while I fold.

It's algorithms week! Time to learn about trees, linked lists, hash tables, and graphs. Its so theoretical and honestly, I wish we began this week 1. More time to practice and conceptualize the topics. I haven't done math in 6 years being a biology major and the last time I had to critically solve was when I was a TA for organic chemistry, so I'm pretty rusty and most of the time I don't get the answer on my own. But I need to keep trying.

I refuse to go into interviews for jobs and know nothing. I need to do my best and keep trying. To think harder, sharper and be the person I want to be.
