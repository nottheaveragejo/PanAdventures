The longest I've gone without sleep is 3 days. I was a junior in college,
had forsaken going to see CASHCASH and Future (two things I would like to have),
at a concert, and locked myself in my room to study for my PCAT. In the days of
old when I thought I would be a pharmacist, the PCAT was the MCAT for pharmacy
school. Meaning that I had to do well. Really well.

By the end of it I was seeing stars and had scored in the 97 percentile. This week,
I felt the ressurgence of that old ghost once more. Pillars marks the midpoint of Junior phase and a means to showcase just how much you know. You have to still learn the new material on the lectures provided, this week it's React, and study the material given. They gave out a pretty decent mock test called Cody's Cafe, a deceivingly cute name for such a difficult mock. I'm working through it though. You have to do it on your own time though and checkpoints are due for React the day after the test.

 It will be up to me to think critically and learn the technologies as well as possible. I know these wont be the exact technologies I use in industry and I'm not sure if I will use them again. But the skill of learning something new and putting depth over breadth. Thats my endgame.
