It was only after getting accepted into pharmacy school and working at CVS in my senior year of college did I decide to jump ship. After much deliberation and trial and error, I set out to write my first novel, Overture. It was written after the spiritual experience of being at a Porter Robinson concert. All the mental blocks faded and the day after, I penned the first page. Pretty soon, I had a manuscript. But when I tried to get feedback for others to read it, I didn't have an audience. This was problematic, so I decided to build my own writing platform where fellow writers can critique and review other'school work as well as receive feedback on their own. I was hooked.
